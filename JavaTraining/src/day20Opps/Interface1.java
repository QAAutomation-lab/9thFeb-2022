/**
 * Interface--> used to achieve abstraction in java
 * 			--> as we know java doesn't support mutliple inheritance using classes to overcome this 
 * 				java provides interface to support this 
 * 			--> its 100% abstract, no non-abstract method
 * 			--> inside interface will have-(no constractor)
 * 					- variable ---> by default--->public static final
 * 					- methods  ---> by default--->public abstract
 * 			--> wheneven a sub class inherits the interface they use implements keyword
 * 				class childclass implements interfacename{
 * 
 * 				}
 * 			--> As we are not allowed to create an instance of abstract class simillarly we are not allowed to create
 * 				instance of interface(because its also incomplete)
 * 			--> when a interface is getting inherited by a sub class, dn there will a contract between these classes thats
 *  			subclass needs to override all the abstract method of interface otherwise subclass becomes abstract class
 * 			--> between 
 * 					1. two classes we use 'extends'
 * 					2. two interface we use 'extends' 
 * 					3. class and interface use 'implements'
