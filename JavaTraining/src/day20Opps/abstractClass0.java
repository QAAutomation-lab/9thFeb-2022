/**
 * class declared with Abstract keyword known as abstract class, 0 to 100% abstract
 * it will have
 * 			- abstract method ----> method declared with abstract keyword without body
 * 			- non-abstract method --> normal method/concrete method
 * 			- constructor
 *  		- static method
 *  		- global variable
 *  Abstract class object can't be create as its incomplete class
 *  
 *  if any class contains even one abstract method dn that class should be declared as abstract class
 *  
 *  when an abstract class is getting inherited by a sub class, dn there will a contract between these classes thats
 *  subclass needs to override all the abstract method of abstract class(super class) otherwise subclass becomes
 *  abstract class
